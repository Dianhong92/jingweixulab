                We aim to investigate the ultra-structural reorganization that the occurs when cells transition into or out of dormant/quiescent state. A particular goal will be focused on the in-depth characterization of different metabolic enzyme polymers across diverse organisms spanning the tree of life.

                <P>
                    Many proteins are capable to form higher-order assemblies. Apart from cytoskeletal elements, several metabolic enzymes have been found to form elaborated filamentous polymers. Interestingly, these metabolic enzyme polymers are often related to the ultra-structural reorganization upon cell stress. The mechanistic insights and cellular functions underlying the remodeling of these filamentous assemblies, however, are still not well understood.
